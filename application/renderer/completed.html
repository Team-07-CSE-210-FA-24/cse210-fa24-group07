  Users can view all their completed tasks and navigate back to the dashboard.

  Key elements:
  - Navbar: Displays the application branding ("DevZen").
  - Heading: "Completed Tasks" title at the top of the page.
  - Task list:
    - Uses an unordered list (id="completed-list") within a container (id="completed-tasks")
      to dynamically display the completed tasks fetched via JavaScript.
  - Action buttons:
    - "Back to Dashboard" button (id="back-to-view") allows users to navigate
      back to the main dashboard page.

  Includes:
  - External CSS stylesheet (`stylemain.css`) for consistent styling.
  - JavaScript file (`completed.js`) to handle fetching and rendering of completed tasks,
    and to provide navigation functionality for the "Back to Dashboard" button.
