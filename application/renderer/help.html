    <h1>The Eisenhower Matrix</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Eisenhower Matrix</strong>, also known as the <strong>Urgent-Important Matrix</strong>, is a time management tool designed to help prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. This method was inspired by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, who famously said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:</p>

    <h3>1. Urgent and Important (Do First)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These are critical tasks that require immediate attention and have significant consequences if not completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Deadlines, emergencies, pressing issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Prioritize these tasks and complete them as soon as possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Not Urgent but Important (Plan)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These tasks are essential for long-term success but do not require immediate action.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Strategic planning, exercise, skill-building, relationship building.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule these tasks to ensure they are completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These tasks demand immediate attention but do not significantly contribute to your goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Interruptions, certain meetings, minor requests from others.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Delegate these tasks to someone else if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Not Urgent and Not Important (Eliminate)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These tasks are distractions and do not contribute to your goals or well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Excessive social media, unnecessary emails, trivial activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Minimize or eliminate these tasks altogether.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visual Representation</h2>
    <p>The matrix is structured as a 2x2 grid:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th><strong>Urgent</strong></th>
                <th><strong>Not Urgent</strong></th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Important</strong></td>
                <td>Do First (Quadrant 1)</td>
                <td>Plan (Quadrant 2)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Not Important</strong></td>
                <td>Delegate (Quadrant 3)</td>
                <td>Eliminate (Quadrant 4)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Helps prioritize tasks effectively.</li>
        <li>Reduces stress by focusing on what truly matters.</li>
        <li>Encourages long-term thinking and planning.</li>
        <li>Helps eliminate distractions and unnecessary tasks.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Focus on <strong>Quadrant 2</strong> tasks (important but not urgent) to prevent crises and achieve long-term goals.</li>
